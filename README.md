# __A journalist Portfolio__
The project is based on the need of a journalist to have a portfolio were as well as employeers and people who are not in the
media business can take a look and contact the person in question.The information in this webpapage
its taken from a real person who is a journalist in Sweden. The picture of the journalist and the information in the 
"work"and "educational" area are real. The information regarding the "Cv" and personal info are ficticious.
